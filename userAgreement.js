   <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c2">5.4 NO FEE FOR INTRODUCING OR FOR FINDING PROJECTS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing does not introduce Clients to Influencers. Influenxing offers a platform that enables Influencers to introduce themselves and may from time to time highlight Projects or Influencers that may be of interest. Therefore, Influenxing does not charge a fee when a Influencer finds a suitable Client or finds a Project. In addition, Influenxing does not charge any fee or dues for posting or viewing feedback, including Composite Information.</span></p>

   <p class="c1"><span class="c2">6. PAYMENT TERMS AND ESCROW SERVICES</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This section describes how Influenxing’s Escrow Services work and discusses your agreement to pay Influencer Service Fees on Service Contracts and Direct Contracts, what happens if a Client doesn’t pay, and related topics.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c2">6.1 ESCROW SERVICES</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing Escrow provides escrow services to Users to deliver, hold, and receive payment for a Project, and to pay fees to Influenxing (“Escrow Services”).</span></p>
   <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c2">6.1.1 ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We follow what is in the applicable Escrow Instructions when we give the money held by us in escrow to the Influencer or back to the Client for a Service Contract.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing Escrow will use and release funds deposited in an Escrow Account only in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. You acknowledge and agree that Influenxing Escrow acts merely as an Internet escrow agent. Influenxing Escrow has fully delivered the Escrow Services to you if Influenxing Escrow provides the Escrow Services described in this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. Influenxing Escrow is only obligated to perform those duties expressly described in this Agreement and any applicable Escrow Instructions. Influenxing will release funds from any Escrow Account in reliance on your authorization, this Agreement, and the applicable Escrow Instructions or as required by applicable law.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fixed-Price Projects. If Users choose fixed-price compensation, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Influenxing Escrow will follow, the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hourly Projects, Bonus Payments, or Expense Payments. If Users choose hourly compensation or if the Client makes bonus or expense payments, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Influenxing Escrow will follow, the Hourly, Bonus and Expense Payment Agreement with Escrow Instructions.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Direct Contracts. If Users enter into a Direct Contract, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Influenxing Escrow will follow, the Direct Contract Escrow Instructions applicable to the contract (Fixed Price or Hourly).</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any Hire Contracts. If Users enter into an Any Hire Contract, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Influenxing Escrow will follow, the Any Hire Escrow Instructions.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing Payroll Engagements. If Users use Influenxing Payroll (see Section 4) for a particular Project, then the Staffing Employee is paid directly by the Staffing Provider. A Client will be invoiced through the Site by the Staffing Provider, and the applicable Escrow Instructions will apply. However, the Client will not be able to dispute hours reported by the Staffing Employee and there is no dispute waiting period for the disbursement of funds to the Staffing Employee.</span></p>
   <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c2">6.1.2 ESCROW ACCOUNTS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing Escrow will create and maintain an account to hold funds for you—called an Escrow Account—based on your needs. You authorize Influenxing Escrow to be your escrow agent, which means to hold your funds and to follow your instructions on the funds held in your Escrow Account.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing Escrow will use and release funds deposited in an Escrow Account only in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable Escrow Instructions, and applicable law. Depending on your needs and the applicable Escrow Instructions, Influenxing Escrow will establish and maintain one of two different types of Escrow Accounts:</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">(A) Client Escrow Account. After entering into a Service Contract (hourly or fixed price) or Direct Contract, the first time a Client makes a payment for a Project, Influenxing Escrow will establish and maintain a “Client Escrow Account” to hold funds for the Client to use to make payments for Projects, to receive refunds in connection with Projects, and to make payments to Influenxing.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">(B) Influencer Escrow Account. After entering into a Service Contract (hourly or fixed price) or Direct Contract, the first time a Influencer uses the Site to receive payment for a Project, Influenxing Escrow will establish and maintain a “Influencer Escrow Account” for Influencer to receive payments for Projects, withdraw payments, make payments to Influenxing and issue refunds to Clients.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You hereby authorize and instruct Influenxing Escrow to act as escrow agent in connection with the Escrow Accounts and the payment, holding, and receipt of funds for each Project and other specified purposes in accordance with the Terms of Service and the applicable Escrow Instructions. Client and Influencer may access current information regarding the status of an Escrow Account on the Site.</span></p>
   <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c2">6.1.4 TITLE TO FUNDS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, and our Affiliates are not banks. We will safeguard your money and not voluntarily make your money available to our creditors.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, and our Affiliates are not banks. Influenxing Escrow deposits and maintains all Escrow Account funds in an escrow trust account at a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and approved to receive, hold, and deliver escrow funds under applicable laws and regulations. The escrow trust account is separate from the operating accounts of Influenxing and each of our Affiliates. Influenxing Escrow will not voluntarily make funds deposited in the escrow trust account available to its creditors, or the creditors of its Affiliates, in the event of a bankruptcy, or for any other purpose. As provided in India Bankruptcy Code, Section 541(d), Influenxing Escrow holds only legal title to, and not any equitable interest in, the escrow trust account and any funds deposited in it. </span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c2">6.1.5 NO INTEREST</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will not earn any interest on the money we hold in your Escrow Account and you understand that we charge fees for our services, as explained in Section 5.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds held in your Escrow Account. Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, or our Affiliates may charge or deduct fees, may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged, and may receive other compensation in connection with the services we provide as provided in Section 5 and the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement.</span></p>
   <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c2">6.1.6 ESCROW AGENT DUTIES</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We only agree to do what is described in this Agreement, the applicable Escrow Instructions, and the rest of the Terms of Service.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We only agree to perform such duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement, the applicable Escrow Instructions, and the other Terms of Service, and no other duties will be implied. We have no liability under, and no duty to inquire as to, the provisions of any agreement, other than the Terms of Service (including this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions). We will be under no duty to inquire about or investigate any agreement or communication between Client and Influencer, even if posted to the Site. We have the right to rely upon, and will not be liable for relying on, any written notice, instruction, or request furnished to us by Client or Influencer in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Escrow Instructions, if we reasonably believe that such notice, instruction, or request is genuine and that it is signed or presented by the proper party or parties. We have no duty to inquire about or investigate the validity, accuracy, or content of any such notice, instruction, or request. We have no duty to solicit any payments or releases that may be due to or from any Escrow Account. We may execute any of our powers and perform any of our duties under this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions directly or through agents or attorneys (and will be liable only for the careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult with counsel, accountants, and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by us. If we are uncertain as to our duties or rights under this Agreement or receive instructions, claims, or demands from any party to this Agreement that, in our opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement or the applicable Escrow Instructions, we will be entitled to refrain from taking any action, and our sole obligation will be to keep safely all property held in the Escrow Account until we are directed otherwise in writing by Client and Influencer or by a final order or judgment of an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.1.7 ESCROW AGENT RIGHT</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We may choose to start a dispute process if there is a disagreement between a Client and a Influencer related to an Escrow Account.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have the right to institute arbitration or other legal proceedings if applicable, including depositing funds held in the Escrow Account with a court of competent jurisdiction, in order to resolve any dispute between Client and Influencer related to the Escrow Account. Except as expressly provided, nothing in this Agreement will be construed to limit our legal and equitable rights, including, but not limited to, depositing funds held in the Escrow Account with a court of competent jurisdiction. Any corporation or association into which Influenxing Escrow may be merged or converted or with which Influenxing Escrow may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all the escrow business of Influenxing Escrow may be transferred will succeed to all the rights and obligations of Influenxing Escrow as escrow holder and escrow agent under this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.2 CLIENT PAYMENTS ON SERVICE CONTRACTS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This section describes when and how Client payments are made on their contracts with Influencers.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hourly Contracts. Influencer will invoice Client for Influencer Fees on a weekly basis through Influenxing, and Client will pay invoices consistent with the Hourly, Bonus, and Expense Payment Agreement with Escrow Instructions or Hourly Direct Contract Escrow Instructions, depending on whether the contract is a Service Contract or a Direct Contract, respectively. When Client approves an Hourly Invoice for an Hourly Contract, Client automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs Influenxing or its affiliates Influenxing Escrow or Elance Ltd. to charge Client’s Payment Method for the Influencer Fees.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fixed-Price Contracts. Client becomes obligated to pay applicable amounts into the Escrow Account immediately upon sending a Fixed-Price Contract offer (for the full amount or for the first milestone, if milestones are used) or upon activating any additional milestone. When Client authorizes the payment of the Influencer Fees for a Fixed-Price Contract under the Fixed Price Service Contract Escrow Instructions or the Fixed Price Direct Contract Escrow Instructions, Client automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs Influenxing or its affiliates Influenxing Escrow or Elance Ltd. to charge Client’s Payment Method for the Influencer Fees.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Client acknowledges and agrees that for both Hourly Contracts and Fixed-Price Contracts, failure by Client to decline or dispute an Hourly Invoice or request for payment is an authorization and instruction to release payment, as described more fully in the applicable Escrow Instructions.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.3 DISBURSEMENTS TO FREELANCERS ON SERVICE CONTRACTS OR DIRECT CONTRACTS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This section describes when Influencers receive their funds that we were holding for the Influencers in escrow.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing Escrow disburses funds that are available in the applicable Influencer Escrow Account and payable to a Influencer as described in the relevant Escrow Instructions. A Influencer can request disbursement of available funds any time on a one-time basis or by setting up an automatic disbursement schedule. Otherwise, except as provided in the following paragraph, Influenxing will automatically disburse available funds no more than ninety (90) days after the Influencer Fees are released to the Influencer Escrow Account, unless the amount in the Escrow Account is less than the Minimum Threshold. For purposes of the Terms of Service, a “Minimum Threshold” is either (a) $100 for Influencers within the India, or (b) $1,000 for Influencers outside the India. Except as provided in the following paragraph, when the funds in the Influencer Escrow Account are below the Minimum Threshold, the automatic disbursement schedule is paused and the available and payable funds are released on the earlier of: (i) Influencer’s request; (ii) on the first scheduled automatic disbursement occurring after the amount exceeds the Minimum Threshold; or (iii) 180 days after the funds are available in the Influencer Escrow Account.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If a Influencer that is located outside of the India is not able to withdraw funds due to economic sanctions applicable to Influenxing or our payment partners, or due to Influenxing's payment partners' refusal to service certain geographic areas, Influenxing will suspend automatic disbursement as provided in the prior paragraph and will safeguard such funds in an Escrow Account, or in another suitable account, as determined in Influenxing's sole discretion, until the earlier of (a) the Influencer is able to and does in fact withdraw the funds, or (b) Influenxing is required by law to escheat the funds to an appropriate legal authority, after which the Influencer can seek to recover the funds from such authority.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hourly Contracts. Influencer Fees become available to Influencers no later than following the expiration of the five-day security period and dispute period.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fixed-Price Contracts. Influencer Fees become available to Influencers no later than following the expiration of the five-day security period. The security period begins after Client accepts work submitted by Influencer and approves payment.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except as expressly provided in the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions and as prohibited by applicable law, Influenxing Escrow may refuse to process, may hold the disbursement of the Influencer Fees or any other amounts and offset amounts owed to us, or take such other actions with respect to the Escrow Account as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion if: (a) we require additional information, such as Influencer’s tax information, government-issued identification or other proof of identity, address, or date of birth; (b) we have reason to believe the Influencer Fees may be subject to dispute or chargeback; (c) we suspect a User has committed or attempted to commit fraud or other illicit acts on or through the Site or is using the Site unlawfully; (d) we believe there are reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the performance of obligations under this Agreement or other Terms of Service; or (e) we deem it necessary in connection with any investigation, required by applicable law, or necessary due to circumstances outside of our control after a commercially reasonable effort has been made by us due to such circumstances. If, after investigation, we determine that the hold on the disbursement of the Influencer Fees is no longer necessary, Influenxing Escrow will release the hold as soon as practicable.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, except as expressly provided in the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse us, if we: (i) suspect fraud or criminal activity associated with your payment, withdrawal, or Project; (ii) discover erroneous or duplicate transactions; or (iii) have supplied our services in accordance with this Agreement yet we receive any chargeback from the Payment Method used by you or your Client despite our provision of the Services in accordance with this Agreement. You agree that we have the right to obtain such reimbursement by instructing Influenxing Escrow (and Influenxing Escrow will have the right) to charge your account(s), offset any amounts determined to be owing, deduct amounts from future payments or withdrawals, charge your Payment Method, or use other lawful means to obtain reimbursement from you. If we are unable to obtain such reimbursement, we may, in addition to any other remedies available under applicable law, temporarily or permanently revoke your access to the Services and close your Account.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.4 NON-PAYMENT OR DEFAULT</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This section describes the actions Influenxing can take if a Client does not pay fees on time. Influenxing is not responsible for a Client’s non-payment of fees.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Client is in “default”, meaning the Client fails to pay the Influencer Fees or any other amounts when due under the Terms of Service, or a written agreement for payment terms incorporating the Terms of Service (signed by an authorized representative of Influenxing), Influenxing will be entitled to the remedies described in this Section 6.4 in addition to such other remedies that may be available under applicable law or in such written agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Client will be deemed to be in default on the earliest occurrence of any of the following: (a) Client fails to pay the Influencer Fees when due; (b) Client fails to pay a balance that is due or to bring, within a reasonable period of time but no more than 30 days after accrual of the charge, an account current after a credit or debit card is declined or expires; (c) Client fails to pay an invoice issued to the Client by Influenxing within the time period agreed or, if no period is agreed, within 30 days; (d) Client initiates a chargeback with a bank or other financial institution resulting in a charge made by Influenxing for Influencer Fees or such other amount due being reversed to the Client; or (e) Client takes other actions or fails to take any action that results in a negative or past-due balance on the Client’s account.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Client is in default, we may, without notice, temporarily or permanently close Client’s Account and revoke Client’s access to the Services, including Client’s authority to use the Site to process any additional payments, enter into Service Contracts or Direct Contracts, or obtain any additional Influencer Services from other Users through the Site. However, Client will remain responsible for any amounts that accrue on any open Projects at the time a limitation is put on the Client’s Account as a result of the default. Without limiting other available remedies, Client must pay Influenxing upon demand for any amounts owed, plus interest on the outstanding amount at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum interest allowed by applicable law, plus attorneys’ fees and other costs of collection to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At our discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, Elance Ltd. or its other Affiliates may, without notice, charge all or a portion of any amount that is owed to any Payment Method on file on the Client’s Account; set off amounts due against other amounts received from Client or held by for Client by Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow or another Affiliate; make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities; and cooperate with credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities in any investigation or prosecution.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing does not guarantee that Client is able to pay or will pay Influencer Fees, and Influenxing is not liable for and may reverse Influencer Fees if Client is in default or initiates a chargeback of funds with their financial institution. Influencer may use the dispute process as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions in order to recover funds from Client in the event of a default or may pursue such other remedies against Client as Influencer chooses. If Influenxing recovers funds from a Client who initiated a chargeback or who is in default pursuant to this Section 6.4, Influenxing will disburse any portion attributable to Influencer Fees to the applicable Influencer to the extent not already paid by Client or credited by Influenxing through any Payment Protection program.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.5 NO RETURN OF FUNDS AND NO CHARGEBACKS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clients agree that, once Influenxing charges their Payment Methods, the charge cannot be refunded except on a condition agreed in the Escrow Instructions. Clients agree not to initiate any chargebacks from their credit card companies, banks, or the like.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Client acknowledges and agrees that Influenxing or its affiliates Influenxing Escrow or Elance Ltd. may charge or debit Client’s designated Payment Method for the Influencer Fees incurred as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions and the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement. Once Influenxing or its affiliates Influenxing Escrow or Elance Ltd. charges or debits the Client’s designated Payment Method for the Influencer Fees, the charge or debit is non-refundable, except as provided in the applicable Escrow Instructions or as otherwise required by applicable law. Client also acknowledges and agrees that the Terms of Service provide a dispute resolution process as a way for Client to resolve disputes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Client therefore agrees not to ask its credit card company, bank, or other Payment Method provider to charge back any Influencer Fees or other fees charged pursuant to the Terms of Service for any reason. A chargeback in breach of this obligation is a material breach of the Terms of Service. If Client initiates a chargeback in violation of this Agreement, Client agrees that Influenxing or its affiliates Influenxing Escrow or Elance Ltd. may dispute or appeal the chargeback, institute collection action against Client, close Client’s account, and take such other action it deems appropriate.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.6 PAYMENT METHODS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clients agree to designate a Payment Method and authorize us to charge that Payment Method.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to use certain Site Services, Client must provide account information for at least one valid Payment Method.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Client hereby authorizes Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, and Elance Ltd., as applicable, to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by Client, to store credit card and banking or other financial details as Client’s method of payment consistent with our Privacy Policy, and to charge Client’s credit card (or any other Payment Method) for the Influencer Fees and any other amounts owed under the Terms of Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to our Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree that we may use certain third-party vendors and service providers to process payments and manage your Payment Method information.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">By providing Payment Method information through the Site or by authorizing payments with the Payment Method, Client represents that: (a) Client is legally authorized to provide such information; (b) Client is legally authorized to make payments using the Payment Method(s); (c) if Client is an employee or agent of a company or person that owns the Payment Method, that Client is authorized by the company or person to use the Payment Method to make payments on Influenxing; and (d) such actions do not violate the terms and conditions applicable to Client’s use of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Client authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Site, Client represents that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement or the other Terms of Service cannot be collected from Client’s Payment Method(s), Client is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing is not liable to any User if Influenxing does not complete a transaction as a result of any limit by applicable law or your financial institution, or if a financial institution fails to honor any credit or debit to or from an account associated with such Payment Method. Influenxing will make commercially reasonable efforts to work with any such affected Users to resolve such transactions in a manner consistent with this Agreement and any applicable Escrow Instructions.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">6.7 U.S. DOLLARS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If your Payment Method uses a currency other than U.S. Dollars, we may show you foreign currency conversion rates for us to change your currency into U.S. Dollars. The rates we show you may be different than the rates that apply to us and may not be the best rate available to you</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Services operate in U.S. Dollars. If a User’s Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars and requires currency conversion to make or receive payments in U.S. Dollars, the Site will display foreign currency conversion rates that Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, Elance Ltd., or our other Affiliates currently make available to convert supported foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars. These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions. Please note that the wholesale currency conversion rates at which we or our Affiliates obtain foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the Site. Each User, at its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge, debit, or credit of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to U.S. Dollars at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site. A list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Site. If foreign currency conversion is required to make a payment in U.S. Dollars and Influenxing, its affiliates Influenxing Escrow or Elance Ltd., as applicable, does not support the foreign currency or the User does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site, Influenxing Escrow or one of our Affiliates will charge, debit, or credit the User’s Payment Method in U.S. Dollars and the User’s Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate selected by the User’s Payment Method provider. The User’s Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method even when no currency conversion is involved. The User’s authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is at the User’s sole risk. Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, Elance Ltd., and our other Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars or for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments to and from the Escrow Account.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">7. NON-CIRCUMVENTION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree to communicate through the Site and make and receive payments only through the Site for two years from the date you first identify or meet your Client or Influencer on the Site, unless you pay a Conversion Fee. Violations of this Section constitute a serious breach and may result in permanent suspension of your Account.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">7.1 MAKING PAYMENTS THROUGH UPWORK</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree to exclusively use Influenxing to make payments for work that arises out of a relationship you made through Influenxing for two years from the date you first established the relationship.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation Influenxing receives for making the Site available to you is collected through the Service Fee described in Section 5.1 and that in exchange a substantial value to you is the relationships you make with other Users identified through the Services (the “Influenxing Relationship”). Influenxing only receives the Service Fee when a Client and a Influencer pay and receive payment through the Site. Therefore, except as set out in Section 7.2, for 24 months from the start of an Influenxing Relationship (the “Non-Circumvention Period”), you agree to use the Site as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that person or arising from that relationship and not to circumvent the Payment Methods offered on the Site unless you pay a fee to take the relationship off of the Site (the “Conversion Fee”). If you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business or its successor when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User. If you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another person through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. By way of example only, you agree that during the Non-Circumvention period you will not:</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Offer or solicit or accept any offer or solicitation from parties identified through the Site to contract, hire, invoice, pay, or receive payment in any manner other than through the Site.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Invoice or report on the Site or in a Conversion Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed, made, or received between Users.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Refer a User you identified on the Site to a third party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments other than through the Site.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree to notify Influenxing immediately if a person suggests making or receiving payments other than through the Site in violation of this Section 7 or if you receive unsolicited contact outside of the Site. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention agreement, please submit a confidential report to Influenxing here.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You acknowledge and agree that a violation of this Section 7.1 is a material breach of the Terms of Service, and may result in your Account being permanently suspended and charged the Conversion Fee (defined above). This Section still applies if you choose to cease using the Site, and you must pay the Conversion Fee for each other User you wish to continue working with after you cease using the Site.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">7.2 COMMUNICATING THROUGH THE SITE; NOT SHARING CONTACT DETAILS</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Prior to entering into a Service Contract, you agree to communicate with other Users exclusively through Influenxing.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The provisions of this Section 7.2 apply to any interaction between Users where the Client has a Basic, Plus, or Marketplace Account, and do not apply to any interaction between Users where the Client is an Enterprise Client. For purposes of the Terms of Service, “Enterprise Client” means a Client, including an Enterprise client or an Influenxing Business Client, that has the following “Enterprise” badge displayed on its job post or search tile:</span></p>
   <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Users subject to this Section 7.2, Users agree to use the communication services available on the Site to communicate with other Users prior to entering into a Service Contract. You agree that prior to entering into a Service Contract, you (a) will use Influenxing as the sole manner to communicate with other Users; (b) will not provide your Means of Direct Contact (defined below) to any other User or another person that you identified or were identified by through the Site; (c) will not use Means of Direct Contact of another user to attempt to or to communicate with, solicit, contact, or find the contact information of a User outside of Influenxing; (d) will not ask for, provide, or attempt to identify through public means the contact information of another User; and (e) will not include any Means of Direct Contact or means by which your contact information could be discovered in any profile, proposal, job posting, invitation, or pre-hire communication through the Site’s communications services (including in each case in any attached file), except as otherwise provided on the Site.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For purposes of the Terms of Service, “Means of Direct Contact” means any information that would allow another person to contact you directly, including, without limitation, phone number, email address, physical address, a link to a contact form or form requesting contact information, any link to an applicant management system or means to submit a proposal or application outside of the Site, or any information that would enable a user to contact you on social media or other website or platform or application that includes a communications tool, such as Skype, Slack, Wechat, or Facebook. Information is a Means of Direct Contact if it would enable another user to identify any of the information above through other sources, such as going to a website that included an email address or identifying you through social media.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You acknowledge and agree that a violation of this Section 7.2 is a material breach of the Terms of Service and your Account may be permanently suspended for such violations.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">7.3 OPTING OUT</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You may opt out of the non-circumvention agreement if you pay a fee.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You may opt out of the obligations in Section 7.1 with respect to each Influenxing Relationship only if the Client or Influencer pays Influenxing a Conversion Fee which is a minimum of $1,000 USD and up to $50,000 USD for each Influenxing Relationship, unless Client and Influencer have had an Influenxing Relationship for at least two (2) years.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Conversion Fee may be calculated differently for Influenxing Relationships when the Client is an Enterprise Client if the Enterprise Client contract with Influenxing provides for different terms.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">To learn more about the Conversion Fee or how to pay it visit our Help Center here.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You understand and agree that if Influenxing determines that you have violated Section 7, it may (a) charge your Payment Method the Conversion Fee (including interest) if permitted by law or send you an invoice for the Conversion Fee (including interest), which you agree to pay within 30 days, (b) close your Account and revoke your authorization to use the Services, and (c) charge you for all losses and costs (including any and all time of Influenxing’s internal workforce) and reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree that the Conversion Fee is 13.5% of the estimated earnings over a twelve (12) month period, which is calculated by taking the Hourly Rate (defined below) and multiplying it by 2,080. “Hourly Rate” means (a) the highest hourly rate charged by the Influencer on any Service Contract with the Client, if any; or (b) if there is no hourly rate on a Service contract, the hourly rate in the Influencer’s profile when the conversion is requested. The Conversion Fee includes all applicable taxes and is not subject to the Marketplace Fee. If Client and Influencer have had an Influenxing Relationship for at least two (2) years, the Conversion Fee is a nominal $1 USD for administrative purposes. The Conversion Fee is not refundable. Influenxing will apply a discount on the Conversion Fee that is equal to the total amount of Marketplace Fees that Client has paid to Influenxing in the preceding twelve (12) months on each marketplace Service Contract between the Client and the Influencer. In no event shall the Conversion Fee be discounted below the minimum of $1,000 USD.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">8. RECORDS OF COMPLIANCE</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree to make and keep all required records.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are solely responsible for creation, storage, and backup of your business records. You agree that Influenxing has no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or information that you provide, except to the extent required by applicable law.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">9. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are not responsible for the quality, safety, or reliability of our Services.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing and its affiliates make no representation or warranty about the services, including that the services will be uninterrupted or error-free, and provide the Services (including content and information) on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Influenxing and its affiliates disclaim any implied or statutory warranty, including any implied warranty of title, accuracy of data, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any liability we may have to you is limited.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Influenxing is not liable, and you agree not to hold us responsible, for any damages or losses arising out of or in connection with the Terms of Service, including, but not limited to: (i) your use of or your inability to use our Site or Site Services; (ii) delays or disruptions in our Site or Site Services; (iii) viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing, or linking to, our Site or Site Services; (iv) glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our Site or Site Services; (v) damage to your hardware device from the use of the Site or Site Services; (vi) the content, actions, or inactions of third parties’ use of the Site or Site Services; (vii) a suspension or other action taken with respect to your Account; (viii) your reliance on the quality, accuracy, or reliability of job postings, Profiles, ratings, recommendations, and feedback (including their content, order, and display), Composite Information, or metrics found on, used on, or made available through the Site; and (ix) your need to modify practices, content, or behavior or your loss of or inability to do business, as a result of changes to the Terms of Service.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additionally, in no event will Influenxing, our affiliates, our licensors, or our third-party service providers be liable for any special, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or indirect costs or damages, including, but not limited to, litigation costs, installation and removal costs, or loss of data, production, profit, or business opportunities. The liability of Influenxing, our affiliates, our licensors, and our third-party service providers to any User for any claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the other Terms of Service will not exceed the lesser of: (a) $2,500 or (b) any fees retained by Influenxing with respect to service contracts on which User was involved as Client or Influencer during the six-month period preceding the date of the claim.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">These limitations will apply to any liability, arising from any cause of action whatsoever arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the other Terms of Service, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, even if Influenxing has been advised of the possibility of such costs or damages and even if the limited remedies provided herein fail of their essential purpose. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow for all of the foregoing exclusions and limitations, so to that extent, some or all of these limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">11. RELEASE</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree not to hold us responsible for any dispute you may have with another User.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In recognition of the fact that Influenxing is not a party to any contract between Users, you hereby release Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, our other Affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, employees and service providers from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have with another User, whether it be at law or in equity that exist as of the time you enter into this Agreement. This release includes, for example and without limitation, any disputes regarding the performance, functions, and quality of the Influencer Services provided to Client by a Influencer and requests for refunds based upon disputes. Procedures regarding the handling of certain disputes between Users are discussed in the Escrow Instructions.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">To the extent applicable, you hereby waive the protections of California Civil Code § 1542 (and any analogous law in any other applicable jurisdiction) which says: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This release will not apply to a claim that Influenxing failed to meet our obligations under the Terms of Service.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">12. INDEMNIFICATION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you do something using our Services that gets us sued or fined, you agree to cover our costs or losses as described below.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Influenxing, Influenxing Escrow, our other Affiliates, and our respective directors, officers, employees, representatives, and agents (each an “Indemnified Party”) for all Indemnified Claims (defined below) and Indemnified Liabilities (defined below) relating to or arising out of: (a) your or your agents’ use of the Services, including any payment obligations or default (described in Section 6.4 (Non-Payment or Default)) incurred through use of the Services; (b) any Work Product or User Content related to your use of the Services; (c) any Service Contract entered into by you or your agents, including, but not limited to, the classification of a Influencer as an independent contractor, any employment-related claims; (d) your or your agents’ failure to comply with the Terms of Service; (e) you or your agents’ failure to comply with applicable law; (f) negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by you or your agents; and (g) you or your agents’ violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity rights or Intellectual Property Rights. For purposes of this Section 12, your agents include any person who has apparent authority to access or use your account demonstrated by using your username and password.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Indemnified Claim” means any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or relating to any claim, suit, proceeding, demand, or action brought by you or a third party or other User against an Indemnified Party.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Indemnified Liability” means any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and all related costs and expenses) arising from or relating to any claim, suit, proceeding, demand, or action brought by an Indemnified Party against you or a third party or other User.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">13. AGREEMENT TERM AND TERMINATION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This section discusses when and how long this Agreement will last, when and how either you or Influenxing can end this Agreement, and what happens if either of us ends the Agreement.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">13.1 TERMINATION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You and Influenxing both have the right to end this Agreement, but certain rights and obligations will survive after this Agreement ends.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unless both you and Influenxing expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. You may provide written notice to legalnotices@Influenxing.com. In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You agree that Influenxing is not a party to any Service Contract between Users. Consequently, you understand and acknowledge that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Service Contract or Project entered into between Users. If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Projects, you agree (a) you hereby instruct Influenxing will close any open contracts; (b) you will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Projects have closed on the Site and your access to the Site has been terminated; (c) Influenxing will continue to perform those Services necessary to complete any open transaction between you and another User; and (d) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any open Service Contracts, whichever is later, to Influenxing for any Services or such other amounts owed under the Terms of Service and to any Influencers for any Influencer Services.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without limiting Influenxing’s other rights or remedies, we may revoke or limit access to the Services, deny your registration, or revoke your access to the Site and refuse to provide any or all Services to you if: (i) you breach any terms and conditions of this Agreement or any portion of the Terms of Service; (ii) we have reasonable reason to believe that you have provided false or misleading information to us; (iii) we conclude that your actions may cause legal liability for you or others; may be contrary to the interests of the Site or the User community; or may involve illicit or illegal activity; or (iv) we are required to by law, legal process, or law enforcement. If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Site under the same Account or a different Account or re-register for a new Account without Influenxing’s prior written consent. If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of Users’ Account status to all Users, including you and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree that: if Influenxing decides to temporarily or permanently close your account, Influenxing has the right (but no obligation) where allowed by law to: (y) notify other users that have entered into Service Contracts with you of your closed account status, and (z) provide those users with a summary of the reasons for your account closure. You agree that Influenxing will have no liability arising from or relating to any notice that it may or may not provide to any user regarding closed account status or the reason(s) for the closure.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">13.2 ACCOUNT DATA ON CLOSURE</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed, you will no longer have access to information or material you kept on the Site and any content stored in your Account may be deleted, for which Influenxing expressly disclaims liability. Influenxing may retain some or all of your Account information as permitted or required by law and the Privacy Policy.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">13.3 SURVIVAL</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement and the other Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions related to arbitration, audits, intellectual property, non-circumvention, indemnification, fees, reimbursements, and limitations of liability each contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates. The termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or Influenxing from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or other parts of the Terms of Service or that may accrue related to any act or omission prior to such termination.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14. DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND UPWORK</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Section 14 discusses your agreement with Influenxing and our agreement with you about how we will resolve any disputes between us, including that we will both first try to resolve any dispute informally and, if you are in the India, that we both agree to use arbitration instead of going to court or using a jury if we can’t resolve the dispute informally.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Please read the following paragraphs carefully because they require you and us to agree to resolve most all disputes between you and us through binding individual arbitration.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.1 DISPUTE PROCESS, ARBITRATION, AND SCOPE</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If a dispute arises between you and Influenxing or our Affiliates, our goal is to resolve the dispute quickly and cost-effectively. Accordingly, unless you opt out as provided in Section 14.4.4 below, you, Influenxing, and our Affiliates agree to resolve any and all claims, disputes, or controversies that arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the other Terms of Service, your relationship with Influenxing (including without limitation any claimed employment with Influenxing or one of our Affiliates or successors), the termination of your relationship with Influenxing, or the Services (each a “Claim” and collectively, “Claims”) through binding arbitration on an individual basis in accordance with this Section 14 (sometimes referred to as the “Arbitration Provision”).</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claims that may not be subject to predispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203), Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (Public Law 117-90), or by generally applicable law are excluded from the coverage of this Arbitration Provision.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">By agreeing to arbitrate disputes under this Agreement, THE PARTIES ARE EXPRESSLY GIVING UP ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OR COURT TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE. The parties instead elect to have Claims resolved by arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on the parties, subject to review on the grounds set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)).</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.2 CHOICE OF LAW</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Agreement, the Site Terms of Use, the other Terms of Service, and any Claim will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions; provided, however, that any Claims made by any Influencer located within the India will be governed by the law of the state in which such Influencer resided at the time the dispute arose.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, this Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.).</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.3 INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before serving a demand for arbitration of a Claim, you and Influenxing agree to first notify each other of the Claim. You agree to notify Influenxing of the Claim by email to legalnotices@Influenxing.com, and Influenxing agrees to provide to you a notice at your email address on file (in each case, a “Notice”). You and Influenxing then will seek informal voluntary resolution of the Claim. Any Notice must include pertinent account information, a brief description of the Claim, and contact information, so that you or Influenxing, as applicable, may evaluate the Claim and attempt to informally resolve it. Both you and Influenxing will have 60 days from the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Claim and avoid the need for further action.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.4 BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER (DOES NOT APPLY TO USERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND ITS TERRITORIES)</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Arbitration Provision applies to all Users located in or who reside in the India and its territories.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the unlikely event the parties are unable to resolve a Claim within 60 days of the receipt of the applicable Notice, you, Influenxing, and our Affiliates agree to resolve the Claim by final and binding individual arbitration before an arbitrator from JAMS, instead of a court or jury. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.4.1 SCOPE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CONDUCT OF ARBITRATION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Arbitration Provision applies to any Claim (defined above) the parties may have, whether based on past, prevent, or future events, and includes all claims and disputes that arose between the parties before the effective date of this Agreement, and survives after your relationship with Influenxing ends. For the avoidance of doubt, Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Terms of Service and the Influenxing Payroll Agreement. This Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration. If for any reason JAMS will not administer the arbitration, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures’ Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect. Arbitration of disputes brought by a User that allege a violation of a consumer protection statute also will be subject to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards, and such arbitrations will be conducted in the same state and within 25 miles of where the User is located. Claims by Influencers that allege employment or worker classification disputes will be conducted in the state and within 25 miles of where Influencer is located in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. The applicable JAMS arbitration rules may be found at www.jamsadr.com or by searching online for “JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures,” “JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules,” or “JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards.” Any dispute regarding the applicability of a particular set of JAMS rules shall be resolved exclusively by the arbitrator. Any party will have the right to appear at the arbitration by telephone and/or video rather than in person.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You and Influenxing will follow the applicable JAMS rules with respect to filing or initial appearance and arbitration fees. The arbitrator shall follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Arbitration Provision does not apply to litigation between Influenxing and you that is or was already pending in a state or federal court or arbitration before the expiration of the opt-out period set forth in Section 14.4.4 below. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no amendment to this Arbitration Provision will apply to any matter pending in an arbitration proceeding brought under this Section 14 unless all parties to that arbitration consent in writing to that amendment.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Arbitration Provision also does not apply to claims for workers compensation, state disability insurance, or unemployment insurance benefits.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with a government agency, including without limitation the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision. This Arbitration Provision also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on those claims, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by this Arbitration Provision. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents or excuses a party from satisfying any conditions precedent or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration. Influenxing will not retaliate against you for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.4.2 INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims. The arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide all disputes arising out of or relating to the arbitrability of a Claim or the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, breach, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision, except as expressly provided below. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court. The parties expressly agree that, except as provided by the Class and Collective Waiver section below, the arbitrator and not a court will decide any question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, including but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Arbitration Provision, this Agreement, or any other part of the Terms of Service is void or voidable.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable, except as set forth in Section 14.4.3 below.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.4.3 CLASS AND COLLECTIVE WAIVER</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Private attorney general representative actions under the California Labor Code are not arbitrable, not within the scope of this Arbitration Provision and may be maintained in a court of law. However, this Arbitration Provision affects your ability to participate in class or collective actions. Both you and Influenxing agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others. There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, validity, or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision herein shall be considered null and void in its entirety and the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. You and Influenxing agree that you will not be retaliated against as a result of your filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum. However, Influenxing may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.4.4 RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You may opt out of the Arbitration Provision contained in this Section 14 by notifying Influenxing in writing within 30 days of the date you first registered for the Site. To opt out, you must send a written notification to Influenxing at Attn: Legal, 655 Montgomery ST STE 490, DPT 17022, San Francisco, CA 94111-2676 that includes (a) your Account username, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address, and (f) a statement indicating that you wish to opt out of the Arbitration Provision. Alternatively, you may send this written notification to legalnotices@Influenxing.com.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Opting out of this Arbitration Provision will not affect any other terms of this Agreement.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you do not opt out as provided in this Section 14.4.4, continuing your relationship with Influenxing constitutes mutual acceptance of the terms of this Arbitration Provision by you and Influenxing. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Agreement and the Arbitration Provision.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">14.4.5 Enforcement of this Arbitration Provision</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Arbitration Provision replaces all prior agreements regarding the arbitration of disputes and is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of disputes covered by this Arbitration Provision. In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">15. GENERAL</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Additional terms of the agreement between you and Influenxing, including that the Terms of Service contain our full agreement, how the agreement will be interpreted and applied, and your agreement not to access the Site from certain locations.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">15.1 ENTIRE AGREEMENT</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Agreement, together with the other Terms of Service, is the only agreement between you and us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services and supersedes any prior agreements between us for actions occurring after the effective date of this Agreement. The only exception to this is a Enterprise Agreement or similar agreement for premium services executed by a duly authorized representative of Influenxing (“Premium Agreement”), in which cases these Terms of Service are superseded to the extent stated in such Premium Agreement but otherwise survive; written email or letter communications or verbal agreements cannot constitute a Premium Agreement.</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">15.2 MODIFICATIONS; WAIVER</span></p>
   <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We may modify these terms and will provide you reasonable advance notice of substantial changes.</span></p>
